The Lythseed community is decentralized, giving you the freedom to branch out.
You are welcome to modify existing projects to fit your needs.
Whether you want to add new features, change the design, 
or use the project as a starting point for something new, 
you are encouraged to do so. However, the original project is
closed to external contributions.

The release date for the first version is still being decided. 
Any technical issue experienced with the initial release will 
be fixed in future updates.

Once our project reaches a milestone of 144 users, we plan to 
make the source code openly available under the BSD License.

Feedback is accepted on functionality, performance, and other issues, 
but not on coding style or best practices.
