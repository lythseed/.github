The Lythseed community is decentralized, giving you the freedom to branch out.
You are welcome to modify existing projects to fit your needs.
Whether you want to add new features, change the design, 
or use the project as a starting point for something new, 
you are encouraged to do so. However, the original project is
closed to external contributions.
